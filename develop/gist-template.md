Title: Mastering Regex for Email Validation in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide

Introduction:
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text searching. This tutorial focuses on creating a regex pattern to validate email addresses. We'll dissect each element of the expression, providing a detailed explanation of its purpose to enhance your understanding of regex.

Regex Pattern:

javascript
Copy code
const emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;
Table of Contents
Anchors:

The ^ anchor matches the start of a line.
The $ anchor matches the end of a line.
These anchors ensure the entire email address adheres to the defined pattern.
Quantifiers:

The + quantifier matches one or more occurrences.
The {2,} quantifier matches two or more occurrences.
Used to validate the username and ensure a minimum of two characters in the top-level domain (TLD).
OR Operator:

The | operator allows matching either a dot (.) or a hyphen (-) in the domain part.
Character Classes:

Utilized for specifying sets of characters at specific positions.
Examples include [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-] and [a-zA-Z].
Grouping and Capturing:

Groups defined by parentheses ( ) isolate sections for further analysis.
Three groups in the pattern represent the username, domain, and TLD.
Username group allows alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, and hyphens.
Domain group allows alphanumeric characters, dots, and hyphens.
TLD group allows alphabetical characters with a minimum length of 2.
Enables easy access and extraction of individual sections for additional processing.
By mastering these regex concepts, you can confidently validate email addresses and understand the intricacies of regex patterns in JavaScript.
